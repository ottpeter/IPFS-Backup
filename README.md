# IPFS-Backup
Backup pinned items from an IPFS node to Filecoin

This is a WIP

 * 1st goal: Possible to sync IPFS repository, based on PeerID, to Filecoin
 * 2nd goal: Simple UI, where we can set target redundancy and see the address of the contract to add funds
 * 3rd goal: Map with the StorageProviders that are storing the data
 * 4th goal: Decentralized access control: target redundancy can not be changed by a single entity
